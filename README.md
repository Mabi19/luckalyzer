This is a tool that calculates probabilities with presets related to Hypixel SkyBlock.
Most of the modes are based on the [Poisson binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution),
computed using an implementation based on [this Python package](https://github.com/tsakim/poibin),
which is an FFT-based approach described in detail [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.006).
